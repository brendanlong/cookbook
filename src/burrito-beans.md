# Burrito Beans

This recipe was created by accident, because I started making burritos, and
then realized that I didn't have any tempeh, tofu or seitan.

## Ingredients

  * 1 can black beans
  * 1 small can green chilis (1/4-1/2 cup?)
  * 1 onion (optional)
  * Oil
  * Salt
  * Liquid smoke

## Instructions

 1. Dice onion and sautee with oil until translucent (5-7 minutes).
 2. Add black beans with liquid (don't drain!).
 3. Add green chilis, salt and liquid smoke.
 4. Leave on low heat until ready to serve.

I usually put this in burritos with rice (with a little salt and lime juice)
and salsa.
