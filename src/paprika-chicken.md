# Paprika Chicken

This recipe is a favorite in Elyse's family and is commonly paired with
cucumber salad. Brendan hasn't made it, so it's unaltered.

## Ingredients

  * 2 medium onions, peeled and minced
  * 2 tbps lard
  * 1 chicken, about 3 lbs, disjoined, washed and dried*
  * 1 large ripe tomato, peeled and cut into pieces
  * 1 heaping tbsp "Noble Rose"** paprika
  * 1 tsp salt
  * 1 green pepper slices
  * 2 tbsp sour cream
  * 1 tbsp flour
  * 2 tbsp heavy cream

\* Elyse's family often makes this dish with chicken breasts; you just have to
be careful not to dry out the chicken while cooking.

\*\*"Noble rose" paprika means "not spicy", and it's basically the only kind
you can buy in the United States. When the dish is served, spicy paprika is at
the table to be added by the individual. Elyse's family prefers to use the
paprika in a paste form if you can find it.

## Instructions

 1. Use a 4- or 5-quary heavy casserole pan with a tight-fitting lid. Cook the
    onions in the lard, covered, over low heat for about 5 minutes. They should
    become almost pasty, but definitely not brown.
 2. Add chicken and tomato and cook, covered, for 10 minutes.
 3. Stir in paprika. Add 1/2 cup water and the salt. Cook, covered, over very
    low heat for 30 minutes. In the beginning, the small amount of water will
    create a steam-cooking action. Toward the end of the 30-minute period, take
    off lid and let the liquid evaporate. Finally, let the chicken cook in its
    own juices and fat, taking care that it does not burn. (If the chicken is
    tough, you may have ot add a few more tablespoons of water.)
 4. Remove chicken pieces. Mix the sour cream, flour, and 1 teaspoon cold
    water, and stir in with the sauce till it is very smooth and of an even
    color. Add green pepper, replace chicken parts, adjust salt. Put lid back
    on casserole and over very low heat cook until done.
 5. Just before serving, whip in the heavy cream.
