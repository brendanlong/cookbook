# Cucumber Salad

I'm not sure what the source for this is. I know that I added a lot more
spices, and reduced the added sugar. You can reduce the spices significantly
if you want, or replace them with entirely different spices if these aren't
your favorites.

## Ingredients

  * 3 english cucumbers*
  * 1 cup vinegar
  * 3/8 cup sugar
  * 1/2 cup water
  * 1 tbsp paprika
  * 1 tbsp garlic
  * 1 tbsp dried onion
  * 1 tbsp salt
  * 1 tbsp pepper

\* English cucumbers have thinner skin, so if you use normal cucumbers, you'll
   probably want to peel them.

## Instructions

 1. Slice cucumbers thinly.
 2. Put the cucumbers and salt in a bowl and mix well so the cucumbers are
    coated.
 3. Leave for an hour (the salt will draw water out of the cucumbers). This
    step can be reduced to 10 minutes if you're in a hurry.
 4. In a seperate bowl, mix water, vinegar, sugar, and spices. Microwave if
    necessary to get the sugar to dissolve.
 5. Add the liquid to the cucumbers and mix well. The liquid won't completely
    cover the cucumbers, but you can add up to a cup more water to make sure
    they're mostly covered. I usually just eat any cucumbers that are above
    the liquid.
 6. Put a lid on the bowl, or move the cucumbers and liquid to a container with
    a lid.
 7. Put it in the refridgerator for at least an hour. Overnight is better.
