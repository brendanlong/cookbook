# Carrot Pie

Adapted from allrecipes.com's "Carrot Pie":

http://allrecipes.com/recipe/carrot-pie/

The original was extremely sweet, noticably eggy, and didn't fill the crust,
so I doubled the amount of carrots, reduced the sugar, and added one more egg
(to match the increased carrots). Elyse requested that we add allspice. I also
simplified the recipe by using a blender.

I use King Arthur Flour's "Classic Single Pie Crust", but any version will do.

## Ingredients

  * 1 (9 inch) pie crust
  * 4 cups carrots
  * 1 cup milk
  * 3 eggs
  * 1/2 cup sugar
  * 1 tsp ground cinnamon
  * 1 tsp vanilla extract
  * 1 tsp allspice (or maybe nutmeg)

## Instructions

 1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
 2. Bake the pie crust for 10 minutes and then remove from the oven.
 3. Chop the carrots.
 4. Add the carrots to the pot with enough water to cover them, and boil for
    10 minutes.
 5. Drain and rinse the carrots (to cool them down so they don't cook the eggs
    in the next step).
 6. Add carrots, milk, eggs, sugar, cinnamon, vanilla and allspice to a blender
    and blend until smooth (or however smooth you want it).
 7. Pour the mixture into the pie crust.
 8. Bake for 10 minutes.
 9. Lower the heat to 350 degrees F, add a pie crust protector if you want, and bake
    for 45 more minutes.
