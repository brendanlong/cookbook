# Carrot Soup

Adapted from Stone Soup's "super simple carrot soup":

The original is extremely good, but it's not very filling. Adding rice helps
to make it more substantial, but it's not quite as tasty.

We discovered this recipe after buying 10 pounds of carrots at Costco. We still
have some of those carrots.

## Ingredients

  * 1 lb carrots
  * 2 onions (optional)
  * 1 16 oz can tomatoes*
  * 3 cups water
  * pinch dried chili flakes (optional)
  * 2-3 tbsp soy sauce
  * 1/2 cup dry rice (optional)
  * 1 cup water or stock (optional)

\* For the tomatoes you can use basically anything: diced, stewed, or even
tomato sauce.

## Instructions

 1. Chop the carrots and onion.
 2. Sautee the onion with oil until soft and starting to brown (7 minutes?).
 3. Add carrots, tomatoes, chili and 3 cups water.
 4. Simmer for 20 minutes.
 5. Blend with a stick blender, food processor or large blender.
 6. If you want to add the rice:
     1. Add rice and 1 cup water or stock.
     3. Put the lid on and simmer for 25 minutes to cook the rice.
 7. Add 2 Tbsp soy sauce and taste. Add more soy sauce if necessary.
