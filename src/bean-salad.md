# Bean Salad

This recipe was created from scratch, since I've found that anything tastes
good with Italian dressing. This lets me use random canned food for a meal I
really like.

## Ingredients

  * 1 can beans (garbanzo are the best, but any will work).
  * 2 cans vegetables (corn, green beans, beets, etc.)
  * Olive oil
  * White vinegar
  * Salt
  * Garlic powder
  * Onion powder

## Instructions

 1. Drain cans and add to a bowl.
 2. Add everything else in tasty ratios.
