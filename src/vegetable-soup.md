# Vegetable Rice Soup

Brendan created this recipe was created from scratch, through months of trial
and error. Elyse doesn't let him make soup more than one a week anymore.

## Ingredients

  * 1 onion (optional)
  * 1 potato (optional)
  * 1 carrot (optional)
  * 1 cup brocolli (optional)
  * 2 stalks celery (optional)
  * 1 cup rice
  * 4 cups stock (or enough to cover the vegetables)
  * 2 cups water
  * A lot of salt
  * Some oil

You'll notice that basically everything is optional. The reason is that you can
make this with whatever you have on-hand, then use enough stock to cover it.

To make pot pie filling, substitute flour instead of the rice.

## Instructions

 1. Dice onion, potato and carrot. Slice celery.
    Cut brocolli into small pieces.
 2. Sautee onion and medium high heat for 7 minutes or until it starts to
    brown.
 3. Add all other vegetables, rice, and enough stock to cover everything.
 4. Add two cups water on top of that. You can use stock for this step too if
    you want.
 5. Add a couple teaspoons of salt. The water shouldn't taste salty at this
    point, but you want some of it to get absorbed by the vegetables, so it
    should be added now.
 6. Bring to a low boil, add the lid, and cook for 25 minutes.

If you're making pot pie filling, you'll need to make a flour/water mixture:

 1. Put flour in a small pot with enough oil to make it stick together.
 2. Cook on medium low heat for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally (online
    recipes recommend them, but I'm not sure if it's actually necessary).
 3. Add two cups of water and blend with an immersion blender. Alternately,
    you might be able to do this in a normal mixer (but it would be hard to
    clean), or you can add the water slowly and mix throughly by hand to
    prevent lumps.
 4. Add water/flour mixture to the soup after it finishes cooking, and stir in.
