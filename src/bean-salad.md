# Bean Salad

This recipe was created from scratch, after the discovery that anything
tastes good with Italian dressing. This lets us use random canned food for a
tasty meal.

## Ingredients

  * 2 cans vegetables (corn, green beans, beets, etc.)
  * 4 tbsp olive oil
  * 4 tbsp white vinegar
  * 1/2 tsp salt
  * 1 tsp garlic powder
  * 1 tsp onion powder
  * 1 tsp paprika

## Instructions

 1. Drain cans and add to a bowl.
 2. Add everything else in tasty ratios.
 3. Mix well.
