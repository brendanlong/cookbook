# Chili

Brendan created this by trial and error, with quite a few pots of chili being
made. Cole rarely eat chili anymore.

## Ingredients

  * 2 cans beans (not garbanzos)
  * 1 can diced tomatoes
  * 1 can tomato paste
  * 1 onion
  * A lot of chili powder
  * Salt

Optionally, pick one of:

  * 1 potato
  * 1/2 cup rice and 1 cup water
  * 1/2 cup textured vegetable protein and 1 cup water 

These will help to make it more substantial. The potatoes are kind of difficult
to get fully cooked, so you might not want to try that on the first time.

## Instructions

 1. Dice onion and sautee until translucent (about 7 minutes on medium high
    heat).
 2. Add everything else. You'll want enough chili powder to taste good, but
    be careful about adding too much, since this can get really spicy.
 3. Simmer on low heat, covered, for 25 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent
    burning. You can also add more liquid if you need to (water, stock, or
    beer).
 4. If the chili is too thick, simmer uncovered until it's the consistency
    you want.
