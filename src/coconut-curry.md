This recipe comes directly from Vegan Dad:

Brendan used to make it frequently, but keeping coconut milk on hand is kind
of difficult. We're planning to look at the asian store to see if we can get
it cheaply.

## Ingredients

  * 2 tsbp oil
  * 1 onion, diced
  * 2 cloves of garlic, minced
  * 1" piece of ginger, minced (sub powdered if necessary)
  * 1 can of chickpeas, drained and rinsed
  * 1 tsp cinnamon
  * 1/2 tsp cloves
  * 1/4 tsp allspice
  * 1/2 tsp garam masala (sub curry powder if necessary)
  * 1 tsp salt
  * 2 heaping tbsp tomato paste
  * 1 can coconut milk
  * 1/4 cup chopped cilantro (optional)

Garam masala is reasonably cheap, and can be found at most non-Costco stores.
Some grocery stores have ginger, but we usually use dried because it's more
convenient.

## Instructions

  1. Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat.
  2. Saute onion and ginger for 12-15 mins, until onion is a deep golden brown.
  3. Add garlic and saute for 1 minute.
  4. Add chickpeas and spices and fry for 2 mins.
  5. Add tomato paste and coconut milk and bring to simmering.
  6. Adjust spices to your liking. 
  7. Garnish with cilantro and serve over rice.
