# Risotto

I don't remember where this recipe is from. It's nice because you don't need
to stir constantly.

## Ingredients

  * 5 cups stock
  * 2 tbsp oil
  * 5 tbsp butter
  * 1 onion
  * 2 cloves garlic
  * 1 3/4 cups rice
  * 1 cup white wine
  * 1/2 cup cheese (mozzarella works well)
  * Some salt

You can mix this up by adding various spices, or sauteed mushrooms, brocolli,
spinach, etc.

## Instructions

 1. Dice onion and press garlic.
 2. Sautee onion for 9 minutes or until translucent.
 3. Add garlic and sautee for another minute.
 4. Add wine, rice and stock. Cook uncovered until the stock and rice have
    boiled off, and the rice is sticky (25 minutes).
 5. Turn off heat and mix in cheese, and anything else you want.
