# Introduction

This is a collection of recipes by Brendan Long and Elyse Blazosky. It could
have been longer, but we thought it would be more useful without padding, so
these are just recipes we really like or cook really often.

We're send this to you as a folder, so when we find new recipes, we can send
them to you to be added.
