It's nice because all of the ingredients are cheap, it requires minimal effort,
and you only need to use one pan.

## Ingredients

  * 1 cup red lentils (you cannot substitute green lentils, they're completely different)
  * 1 cup rice
  * 4 cups water
  * 1 can of diced tomatoes
  * 2 tbsp oil*
  * 1/2 tbsp garlic*
  * 1/2 tbsp curry powder*
  * 1 tbsp salt*

\* For the oil and spices, you can add more or less based on your preferences.
You could probably go as low as 1 tbsp oil and 1 tsp each of garlic and curry
powder.

## Instructions

 1. Put the oil and spices in a pot and turn on the heat (I'm impatient so I usually put it on high).
 2. Once the oil/spice mixture starts bubbling, add the rice and lentils.
 3. Add the diced tomatoes.
 4. Add the water and salt.
 5. Once it starts boiling again, put a lid on the pot, turn the heat down to "4" and set a timer for 30 minutes.

    You can tell if the heat is too low if there's no steam coming out, and it's too high if there's a lot of steam.

    Don't take the lid off until the timer goes off. The rice won't cook properly.
 6. Once the timer runs off, turn off the heat, take the lid off, and stir it up.

    If the mixture is still watery, cook it uncovered until it's the consistency you want, and turn the heat up more next time you cook it. If the mixture burned, keep the heat lower next time.
 7. Add more salt if needed.
