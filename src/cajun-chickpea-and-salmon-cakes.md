Elyse really likes this recipe, and discovered that it's even better with
salmon (she uses the cans from Costco). Our version uses more paprika, since
we love paprika.

## Ingredients

  * 1 onion
  * 1 celery stalk (optional)
  * 1 16 oz can chickpeas
  * 1 7 oz can salmon (optional)
  * 1 tsp thyme
  * 2 tsp paprika
  * cayenne pepper to taste
  * 1 tsp hot sauce
  * 1 tsp parsley
  * 2 tbsp flour
  * 1 tbsp corn starch

## Instructions

 1. Dice onion and slice celery.
 2. Sautee onion and celery until soft (5-7 minutes).
 3. Place chickpeas, onions and celery in a food processor and blend until the
    chickpeas are broken up, but not too much.
 4. Move chickpea mixture to a bowl, add salmon and spices. Mix well.
 5. Add flour and cornstarch and mix well.
 6. Shape into small patties and fry in batches, 2-3 minutes per side or until
    crispy and browned. Flip multiple times if necessary. If the patties don't
    stay together, add more cornstarch.
