# Carrot Pie

Adapted from allrecipes.com's "Carrot Pie":

http://allrecipes.com/recipe/carrot-pie/

The original was extremely sweet, noticably eggy, and didn't fill the crust,
so we doubled the amount of carrots, reduced the sugar, and added one more
egg (to match the increased carrots). We also added allspice.

Our recipe is significantly simpler because we use a blender, but it could
be done by hand with a potato masher.

Most recently, we used King Arthur Flour's "Classic Single Pie Crust", but
any pie crust will work.

## Ingredients

  * 1 (9 inch) pie crust
  * 4 cups carrots
  * 1 1/2 cup milk
  * 4 eggs
  * 1 cup sugar
  * 1 tsp ground cinnamon
  * 1 tsp vanilla extract
  * 1 tsp allspice (or maybe nutmeg)

It's possible to use only three eggs and one cup of milk, but the texture will be
less custardy. It's still edible with 1/2 cup sugar, but not very good. 3/4 cup
sugar might work, but we haven't tried it yet.

## Instructions

 1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
 2. Bake the pie crust for 10 minutes and then remove from the oven.
 3. Chop the carrots.
 4. Add the carrots to the pot with enough water to cover them, and boil for
    10 minutes.
 5. Drain and rinse the carrots (to cool them down so they don't cook the eggs
    in the next step).
 6. Add carrots, milk, eggs, sugar, cinnamon, vanilla and allspice to a blender
    and blend until smooth (or however smooth you want it).
 7. Pour the mixture into the pie crust.
 8. Bake for 10 minutes.
 9. Lower the heat to 350 degrees F, add a pie crust protector if you want, and bake
    for 45 more minutes.
