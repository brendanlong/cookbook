# Burrito Beans

This recipe was created by Brendan by accident, because he started making
burritos, and then realized that there wasn't any tempeh, tofu, seitan or
textured vegetable protein in the apartment.

## Ingredients

  * 1 can black beans
  * 1 small can green chilis (1/4-1/2 cup?)
  * 1 onion (optional)
  * Oil
  * Salt
  * Liquid smoke

## Instructions

 1. Dice onion and sautee with oil until translucent (5-7 minutes).
 2. Add black beans with liquid (don't drain!).
 3. Add green chilis, salt and liquid smoke.
 4. Leave on low heat until ready to serve.

We usually put this in burritos with rice (with a little salt and lime juice)
and salsa.
